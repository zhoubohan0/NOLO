Act as a navigation robot in an indoor room. The last frame is the goal frame, and the second-to-last frame is the current observation. Others are history frames. Your task is to navigate to the place spicified by the last goal frame. Let's think step by step:
1. You are in the current observation frame. Can you observe the target object in the current frame? 
2. If yes, you can directly move towards it.
3. If not, can you recognize the target object in the history frames? 
4. If yes, think about how to move to the target object.
5. If not, execute an action from [forward, left, right] each time to find the target object.
6. You can repeat an action multiple times, e.g., (forward,5). You are encouraged to plan more repeats and more steps.
7. Repeat above steps until you find the target object.
Only output a list of (action, repeat) pairs finally, e.g., [(forward,5), (left,3), (forward,2)]'.
